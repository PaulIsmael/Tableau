**British Employment Project**

# Tableau Project Summary

Welcome to my Tableau project! This GitHub repository showcases my work with British Employment data, where I used Excel for data cleaning and transformation, and Tableau for creating an interactive dashboard.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project focuses on British Employment data. It contains valuable information about employment trends and statistics in the United Kingdom. This project is dedicated to examining changes in employment patterns and trends in the United Kingdom. Our goal is to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the British job market by analyzing historical employment data, identifying key factors influencing these changes, and visualizing our findings.
## Key Aspects

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: In the initial phase of the project, I thoroughly cleaned and transformed the raw data using Excel. This process involved addressing missing values, handling outliers, and structuring the data for analysis.

- **Critical Thinking**: Throughout the project, I employed critical thinking to identify significant insights and trends within the dataset. The ability to ask the right questions and uncover key findings was crucial to this project.

- **Data Visualizations**: The heart of this project is the Tableau dashboard. It presents the cleaned and transformed data in an interactive and visually appealing manner, making it easier to explore employment trends and statistics.
